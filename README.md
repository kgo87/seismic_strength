# Seismic strength of the structure
This repository contains the structural calculations to determine the seismic strength of the building. The strength calclulations depend on the location of the building, soil conditions, and the dimensions of the building. The soil consitions and the location are related to probabilistic ground motion.
The ground motion coefficients are obtained from the USGS seismic website by sending a request to: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/designmaps). 
The tool is interactive and require multiple user inputs.
The code was developed in 2018 to automate calculations for a variety of different buildings.
The program is limited to a conventional (rectangular-shaped) buildings.
